    "#### Balanced Parenthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Pranjal passed from his 5th standard and now knows about Bodmas.(bracket , of , division , multiplication , addition , substraction) . A parenthesis sequence is a string, containing only characters \"(\" and \")\"  \"{\" and\"}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A correct parenthesis sequence is a parenthesis sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters \"1\" and \"+\" between the original characters of the sequence. For example, parenthesis sequences \"()()\", \"(())\" are correct (the resulting expressions are: \"(1+1)+(1+1)\", \"((1+1)+1)\"), while \")(\" and \")\" are not. Note that the empty string is a correct parenthesis sequence by definition. \n",
    "Moving on Pranjal decided to list sequences of correct parenthesis using two brackets () and {}.\n",
    "help pranjal make list of off possible correct output for a given no of (,) given by n and { , } given by m.\n",
    "A correct sequence of parenthesis is the one where '')'' comes only after atleast one \"(\" and similar for {}.\n",
    "Also give preference to printing ( first than {.\n",
